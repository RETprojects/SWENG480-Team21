This repository contains the code for our capstone project, the Design Pattern Recommendation System.

## Dependencies
We use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to manage dependencies. Make sure this is installed and included in your PATH.

To install all dependencies, run `pipenv install` in the root directory.

For more information on dependency management in Python, see [this](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) article.

## Code Style
We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code style/formatting. This repository is preconfigured for use with Visual Studio Code. To set up
Black for PyCharm, follow [these](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#pycharm-intellij-idea) instructions.
