# Machine Learning

This folder is composed of multiple parts. `data` contains various CSV and Excel files used to power our clustering algorithms. `experiments` contains Jupyter notebooks and the data the powers them.

`predict.py` is our command-line program that provides recommendations to a user given a design problem. Eventually, we hope to grow this into a web-based program.

## Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed with `pipenv install`.
