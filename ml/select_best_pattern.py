# compute the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of the problem and
# the patterns of the corresponding pattern class


# apply eqs. to suggest the right pattern(s)


# repeat for the other problems


# use eq. to select the best similarity option by considering the ratio of the
# number of right suggested and total suggested design patterns
