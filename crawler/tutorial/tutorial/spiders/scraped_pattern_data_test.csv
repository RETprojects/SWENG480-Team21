"
7,0,adapter,"
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.
Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
","An ""off the shelf"" component offers compelling functionality that you
would like to reuse, but its ""view of the world"" is not compatible
with the philosophy and architecture of the system currently being
developed.","Reuse has always been painful and elusive.  One reason has been the
tribulation of designing something new, while reusing something old.
There is always something not quite right between the old and the new.
It may be physical dimensions or misalignment.  It may be timing or
synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method
expects to receive ""x, y, w, h"" parameters.  But the client wants
to pass ""upper left x and y"" and ""lower right x and y"".  This
incongruity can be reconciled by adding an additional level of
indirection – i.e. an Adapter object.

The Adapter could also be thought of as a ""wrapper"".

"
8,0,prototype,"
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future
instances.
The new operator considered harmful.
","Application ""hard wires"" the class of object to create in each
""new"" expression.","Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual ""clone""
method, and, maintains a dictionary of all ""cloneable"" concrete derived
classes.  Any class that needs a ""polymorphic constructor"" capability:
derives itself from the abstract base class, registers its prototypical
instance, and implements the clone() operation.The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the ""new""
operator on a hard-wired class name, calls a ""clone"" operation on the
abstract base class, supplying a string or enumerated data type that
designates the particular concrete derived class desired.","The Factory knows how to find the correct Prototype, and each Product
knows how to spawn new instances of itself.

"
9,0,facade,"
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier
to use.
Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
","A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the
overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",
and interjects a wrapper that tames the amorphous and inscrutable
mass of software.

SubsystemOne and SubsystemThree do not
interact with the internal components of SubsystemTwo.
They use the SubsystemTwoWrapper ""facade"" (i.e. the
higher level abstraction).

"
10,0,composite,"
Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.
Recursive composition
""Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory.""
1-to-many ""has a"" up the ""is a"" hierarchy
","Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of ""primitive""
and ""composite"" objects.  Processing of a primitive object is handled
one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently.
Having to query the ""type"" of each object before attempting to process
it is not desirable.","Define an abstract base class (Component) that specifies the behavior
that needs to be exercised uniformly across all primitive and composite
objects.  Subclass the Primitive and Composite classes off of the
Component class.  Each Composite object ""couples"" itself only to the
abstract type Component as it manages its ""children"".Use this pattern whenever you have ""composites that contain components,
each of which could be a composite"".Child management methods [e.g. addChild(), removeChild()] should
normally be defined in the Composite class.  Unfortunately, the desire
to treat Primitives and Composites uniformly requires that these
methods be moved to the abstract Component class.  See the ""Opinions""
section below for a discussion of ""safety"" versus ""transparency""
issues.","Composites that contain Components, each of which could be a
Composite.

Menus that contain menu items, each of which could be a menu.Row-column GUI layout managers that contain widgets, each of which
could be a row-column GUI layout manager.Directories that contain files, each of which could be a directory.Containers that contain Elements, each of which could be a Container."
11,0,flyweight,"
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

"
12,0,command,"
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.
Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."
13,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

"
14,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
15,0,factory_method,"
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate.  Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own

implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and

steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,

(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide

Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.

The focus/distinction is on creating complex aggregates.The ""director"" invokes ""builder"" services as it interprets the external format.  The ""builder"" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state.  When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the ""builder"".Affords finer control over the construction process.  Unlike creational patterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the control of the ""director"".","The Reader encapsulates the parsing of the common input.  The Builder hierarchy makes possible the polymorphic creation of many peculiar representations or targets.

","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""

at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is
required.Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following
criteria are satisfied:
Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable
Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.The ""static member function accessor"" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer
to the discussion in the book.Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem.

A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.

the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that

A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,

"
49,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
50,0,factory_method,"
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate.  Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

51,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize

Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented

one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another

Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,

","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

Promote to ""full object status"" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
","Need to ""abstract"" the traversal of wildly different data structures
so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with
each transparently.","""An aggregate object such as a list should give you a way to access
its elements without exposing its internal structure.  Moreover, you
might want to traverse the list in different ways, depending on what
you need to accomplish.  But you probably don't want to bloat the List
interface with operations for different traversals, even if you
could anticipate the ones you'll require.  You might also need to have
more than one traversal pending on the same list."" And,
providing a uniform interface for traversing many types of aggregate
objects (i.e. polymorphic iteration) might be valuable.The Iterator pattern lets you do all this.  The key idea is to take the
responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object
and put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal
protocol.The Iterator abstraction is fundamental to an emerging technology
called ""generic programming"".  This strategy seeks to explicitly
separate the notion of ""algorithm"" from that of ""data structure"".  The
motivation is to: promote component-based development, boost
productivity, and reduce configuration management.As an example, if you wanted to support four data structures (array,
binary tree, linked list, and hash table) and three algorithms (sort,
find, and merge), a traditional approach would require four times three
permutations to develop and maintain.  Whereas, a generic programming
approach would only require four plus three configuration items.","The Client uses the Collection class' public interface directly.  But
access to the Collection's elements is encapsulated behind the
additional level of abstraction called Iterator.  Each Collection
derived class knows which Iterator derived class to create and return.
After that, the Client relies on the interface defined in the Iterator
base class.

"

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
58,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

"
59,0,observer,"
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object

in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

Subject represents the core (or independent or common or engine)
abstraction.  Observer represents the variable (or dependent or
optional or user interface) abstraction.  The Subject prompts the

on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

"
67,0,facade,"
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier
to use.
Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
","A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the
overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",
and interjects a wrapper that tames the amorphous and inscrutable
mass of software.

SubsystemOne and SubsystemThree do not
interact with the internal components of SubsystemTwo.
They use the SubsystemTwoWrapper ""facade"" (i.e. the
higher level abstraction).

"
68,0,composite,"
Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.
Recursive composition
""Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory.""
1-to-many ""has a"" up the ""is a"" hierarchy
","Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of ""primitive""
and ""composite"" objects.  Processing of a primitive object is handled
one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently.
Having to query the ""type"" of each object before attempting to process
it is not desirable.","Define an abstract base class (Component) that specifies the behavior
that needs to be exercised uniformly across all primitive and composite
objects.  Subclass the Primitive and Composite classes off of the
Component class.  Each Composite object ""couples"" itself only to the
abstract type Component as it manages its ""children"".Use this pattern whenever you have ""composites that contain components,
each of which could be a composite"".Child management methods [e.g. addChild(), removeChild()] should
normally be defined in the Composite class.  Unfortunately, the desire
to treat Primitives and Composites uniformly requires that these
methods be moved to the abstract Component class.  See the ""Opinions""
section below for a discussion of ""safety"" versus ""transparency""
issues.","Composites that contain Components, each of which could be a
Composite.

Menus that contain menu items, each of which could be a menu.Row-column GUI layout managers that contain widgets, each of which
could be a row-column GUI layout manager.Directories that contain files, each of which could be a directory.Containers that contain Elements, each of which could be a Container."
69,0,decorator,"
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality.
Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively
wrapping it.
Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.
","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

But the Decorator pattern suggests giving the client the ability
to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));
aWidget->draw();
This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

Another example of cascading (or chaining) features together
to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(
    new FileStream(""fileName.dat"")));
aStream->putString( ""Hello world"" );
The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().
The client may, or may not, be interested in OptionalOne.doThis()
and OptionalTwo.doThis().  Each of these classes always
delegate to the Decorator base class, and that class always delegates
to the contained ""wrappee"" object.

"
70,0,flyweight,"
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

"
71,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.


","By defining a Subject interface, the presence of the Proxy object
standing in place of the RealSubject is transparent to the client.

"
72,0,builder,"
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
",An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.,"Separate the algorithm for interpreting (i.e. reading and parsing) a stored persistence mechanism (e.g. RTF files) from the algorithm for building and representing one of many target products (e.g. ASCII, TeX, text widget).  The focus/distinction is on creating complex aggregates.The ""director"" invokes ""builder"" services as it interprets the external format.  The ""builder"" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state.  When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the ""builder"".Affords finer control over the construction process.  Unlike creational patterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the control of the ""director"".","The Reader encapsulates the parsing of the common input.  The Builder hierarchy makes possible the polymorphic creation of many peculiar representations or targets.

"
73,0,bridge,"
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
can vary independently.
Publish interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury
implementation in its own inheritance hierarchy.
Beyond encapsulation, to insulation
","""Hardening of the software arteries"" has occurred by using subclassing
of an abstract base class to provide alternative implementations.  This
locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation.
The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or
composed.","Decompose the component's interface and implementation into orthogonal
class hierarchies.  The interface class contains a pointer to
the abstract implementation class.  This pointer is initialized with an
instance of a concrete implementation class, but all subsequent interaction
from the interface class to the implementation class is limited to the
abstraction maintained in the implementation base class.  The client
interacts with the interface class, and it in turn ""delegates"" all
requests to the implementation class.The interface object is the ""handle"" known and used by the client;
while the implementation object, or ""body"", is safely encapsulated to
ensure that it may continue to evolve, or be entirely replaced (or shared
at run-time.Use the Bridge pattern when:
you want run-time binding of the implementation,
you have a proliferation of classes resulting from a coupled
interface and numerous implementations,
you want to share an implementation among multiple objects,
you need to map orthogonal class hierarchies.
Consequences include:
decoupling the object's interface,
improved extensibility (you can extend (i.e. subclass) the
abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently),
hiding details from clients.
Bridge is a synonym for the ""handle/body"" idiom.  This is a design mechanism that
encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class.  The
former is the body, and the latter is the handle.  The handle is viewed
by the user as the actual class, but the work is done in the body.
""The handle/body class idiom may be used to decompose a complex
abstraction into smaller, more manageable classes.  The idiom may
reflect the sharing of a single resource by multiple classes that
control access to it (e.g. reference counting).""","The Client doesn't want to deal with platform-dependent details.
The Bridge pattern encapsulates this complexity behind an abstraction
""wrapper"".Bridge emphasizes identifying and decoupling ""interface"" abstraction
from ""implementation"" abstraction.

"
75,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
76,0,command,"
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.
Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."
77,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

"
78,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

"
79,0,iterator,"
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
The C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible
to decouple collection classes and algorithms.
Promote to ""full object status"" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
","Need to ""abstract"" the traversal of wildly different data structures
so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with
each transparently.","""An aggregate object such as a list should give you a way to access
its elements without exposing its internal structure.  Moreover, you
might want to traverse the list in different ways, depending on what
you need to accomplish.  But you probably don't want to bloat the List
interface with operations for different traversals, even if you
could anticipate the ones you'll require.  You might also need to have
more than one traversal pending on the same list."" And,
providing a uniform interface for traversing many types of aggregate
objects (i.e. polymorphic iteration) might be valuable.The Iterator pattern lets you do all this.  The key idea is to take the
responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object
and put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal
protocol.The Iterator abstraction is fundamental to an emerging technology
called ""generic programming"".  This strategy seeks to explicitly
separate the notion of ""algorithm"" from that of ""data structure"".  The
motivation is to: promote component-based development, boost
productivity, and reduce configuration management.As an example, if you wanted to support four data structures (array,
binary tree, linked list, and hash table) and three algorithms (sort,
find, and merge), a traditional approach would require four times three
permutations to develop and maintain.  Whereas, a generic programming
approach would only require four plus three configuration items.","The Client uses the Collection class' public interface directly.  But
access to the Collection's elements is encapsulated behind the
additional level of abstraction called Iterator.  Each Collection
derived class knows which Iterator derived class to create and return.
After that, the Client relies on the interface defined in the Iterator
base class.

"
80,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
81,0,observer,"
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject
abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components
in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

Subject represents the core (or independent or common or engine)
abstraction.  Observer represents the variable (or dependent or
optional or user interface) abstraction.  The Subject prompts the
Observer objects to do their thing.  Each Observer can call back

"
84,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients

Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
","An ""off the shelf"" component offers compelling functionality that you
would like to reuse, but its ""view of the world"" is not compatible
with the philosophy and architecture of the system currently being
developed.","Reuse has always been painful and elusive.  One reason has been the
tribulation of designing something new, while reusing something old.
There is always something not quite right between the old and the new.

synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method
expects to receive ""x, y, w, h"" parameters.  But the client wants
to pass ""upper left x and y"" and ""lower right x and y"".  This
incongruity can be reconciled by adding an additional level of
indirection – i.e. an Adapter object.

The Adapter could also be thought of as a ""wrapper"".

"
86,0,singleton,"
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of
access to it.
Encapsulated ""just-in-time initialization"" or ""initialization on
first use"".
","Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object.  Additionally,
lazy initialization and global access are necessary.","Make the class of the single instance object responsible for creation,
initialization, access, and enforcement.  Declare the instance as a
private static data member.  Provide a public static member function
that encapsulates all initialization code, and provides access to the
instance.The client calls the accessor function (using the class name and scope
resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is
required.Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following
criteria are satisfied:
Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable
Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.The ""static member function accessor"" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer
to the discussion in the book.Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem.
  See ""To Kill A Singleton"" by John Vlissides for a discussion.","

Make the class of the single instance responsible for access and
""initialization on first use"".  The single instance is a private
static attribute. The accessor function is a public static method.

"
87,0,builder,"
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
",An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.,"Separate the algorithm for interpreting (i.e. reading and parsing) a stored persistence mechanism (e.g. RTF files) from the algorithm for building and representing one of many target products (e.g. ASCII, TeX, text widget).  The focus/distinction is on creating complex aggregates.The ""director"" invokes ""builder"" services as it interprets the external format.  The ""builder"" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state.  When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the ""builder"".Affords finer control over the construction process.  Unlike creational patterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the control of the ""director"".","The Reader encapsulates the parsing of the common input.  The Builder hierarchy makes possible the polymorphic creation of many peculiar representations or targets.

"
88,0,factory_method,"
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate.  Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

"
89,0,prototype,"
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future
instances.
The new operator considered harmful.
","Application ""hard wires"" the class of object to create in each
""new"" expression.","Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual ""clone""
method, and, maintains a dictionary of all ""cloneable"" concrete derived
classes.  Any class that needs a ""polymorphic constructor"" capability:
derives itself from the abstract base class, registers its prototypical
instance, and implements the clone() operation.The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the ""new""
operator on a hard-wired class name, calls a ""clone"" operation on the
abstract base class, supplying a string or enumerated data type that
designates the particular concrete derived class desired.","The Factory knows how to find the correct Prototype, and each Product
knows how to spawn new instances of itself.

"
90,0,composite,"
Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.
Recursive composition
""Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory.""
1-to-many ""has a"" up the ""is a"" hierarchy
","Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of ""primitive""
and ""composite"" objects.  Processing of a primitive object is handled
one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently.
Having to query the ""type"" of each object before attempting to process
it is not desirable.","Define an abstract base class (Component) that specifies the behavior
that needs to be exercised uniformly across all primitive and composite
objects.  Subclass the Primitive and Composite classes off of the
Component class.  Each Composite object ""couples"" itself only to the
abstract type Component as it manages its ""children"".Use this pattern whenever you have ""composites that contain components,
each of which could be a composite"".Child management methods [e.g. addChild(), removeChild()] should
normally be defined in the Composite class.  Unfortunately, the desire
to treat Primitives and Composites uniformly requires that these
methods be moved to the abstract Component class.  See the ""Opinions""
section below for a discussion of ""safety"" versus ""transparency""
issues.","Composites that contain Components, each of which could be a
Composite.

Menus that contain menu items, each of which could be a menu.Row-column GUI layout managers that contain widgets, each of which
could be a row-column GUI layout manager.Directories that contain files, each of which could be a directory.Containers that contain Elements, each of which could be a Container."
91,0,decorator,"
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality.
Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively
wrapping it.
Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.
","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

But the Decorator pattern suggests giving the client the ability
to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));
aWidget->draw();
This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

Another example of cascading (or chaining) features together
to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(
    new FileStream(""fileName.dat"")));
aStream->putString( ""Hello world"" );
The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().
The client may, or may not, be interested in OptionalOne.doThis()
and OptionalTwo.doThis().  Each of these classes always
delegate to the Decorator base class, and that class always delegates
to the contained ""wrappee"" object.

"
92,0,adapter,"
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.
Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
","An ""off the shelf"" component offers compelling functionality that you
would like to reuse, but its ""view of the world"" is not compatible
with the philosophy and architecture of the system currently being
developed.","Reuse has always been painful and elusive.  One reason has been the
tribulation of designing something new, while reusing something old.
There is always something not quite right between the old and the new.
It may be physical dimensions or misalignment.  It may be timing or
synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter

"
93,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.


","By defining a Subject interface, the presence of the Proxy object
standing in place of the RealSubject is transparent to the client.

"
94,0,facade,"
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier
to use.
Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
","A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the
overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",
and interjects a wrapper that tames the amorphous and inscrutable
mass of software.

SubsystemOne and SubsystemThree do not
interact with the internal components of SubsystemTwo.
They use the SubsystemTwoWrapper ""facade"" (i.e. the
higher level abstraction).

"
95,0,abstract_factory,"
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible ""platforms"", and the construction of a suite of ""products"".
The new operator considered harmful.
","If an application is to be portable, it needs to
encapsulate platform dependencies.  These ""platforms""
might include: windowing system, operating system,
database, etc.  Too often, this encapsulation is not
engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements
with options for all currently supported platforms begin
to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.","Provide a level of indirection that abstracts the creation
of families of related or dependent objects without directly
specifying their concrete classes.  The ""factory"" object has
the responsibility for providing creation services for the
entire platform family.  Clients never create platform objects
directly, they ask the factory to do that for them.This mechanism makes exchanging product families easy because
the specific class of the factory object appears only once in
the application - where it is instantiated.  The application
can wholesale replace the entire family of products simply by
instantiating a different concrete instance of the abstract
factory.Because the service provided by the factory object is so
pervasive, it is routinely implemented as a Singleton.","The Abstract Factory defines a Factory Method per product.
Each Factory Method encapsulates the new operator
and the concrete, platform-specific, product classes.
Each ""platform"" is then modeled with a Factory derived class.

"
96,0,flyweight,"
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

"
97,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

"
98,0,command,"
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.
Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."

"
100,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
101,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

"
102,0,iterator,"
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
The C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible
to decouple collection classes and algorithms.
Promote to ""full object status"" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
","Need to ""abstract"" the traversal of wildly different data structures
so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with
each transparently.","""An aggregate object such as a list should give you a way to access
its elements without exposing its internal structure.  Moreover, you
might want to traverse the list in different ways, depending on what
you need to accomplish.  But you probably don't want to bloat the List
interface with operations for different traversals, even if you
could anticipate the ones you'll require.  You might also need to have
more than one traversal pending on the same list."" And,
providing a uniform interface for traversing many types of aggregate
objects (i.e. polymorphic iteration) might be valuable.The Iterator pattern lets you do all this.  The key idea is to take the
responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object
and put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal
protocol.The Iterator abstraction is fundamental to an emerging technology
called ""generic programming"".  This strategy seeks to explicitly
separate the notion of ""algorithm"" from that of ""data structure"".  The
motivation is to: promote component-based development, boost
productivity, and reduce configuration management.As an example, if you wanted to support four data structures (array,
binary tree, linked list, and hash table) and three algorithms (sort,
find, and merge), a traditional approach would require four times three
permutations to develop and maintain.  Whereas, a generic programming
approach would only require four plus three configuration items.","The Client uses the Collection class' public interface directly.  But
access to the Collection's elements is encapsulated behind the
additional level of abstraction called Iterator.  Each Collection
derived class knows which Iterator derived class to create and return.
After that, the Client relies on the interface defined in the Iterator
base class.

"
103,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
104,0,observer,"
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject
abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components
in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

Subject represents the core (or independent or common or engine)
abstraction.  Observer represents the variable (or dependent or
optional or user interface) abstraction.  The Subject prompts the
Observer objects to do their thing.  Each Observer can call back
to the Subject as needed."
105,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

"
106,0,strategy,"
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury
implementation details in derived classes.
","One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented
design is the ""open-closed principle"".Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved -
encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury
implementation details in derived classes.  Clients can
then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to
experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact
when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact
when the implementation of a derived class changes.

A generic value of the software community for years has been,
""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"".  The object-oriented
design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing
coupling.  Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction
(i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of
that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing
""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more
generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling""
principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection""
that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords.
The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"")
the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that
interface are effectively hidden.",,"The Interface entity could represent either an
abstract base class, or the method signature expectations by
the client.  In the former case, the inheritance hierarchy
represents dynamic polymorphism.  In the latter case, the Interface
entity represents template code in the client and the inheritance
hierarchy represents static polymorphism.

113,0,decorator,"
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively

Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.
","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

But the Decorator pattern suggests giving the client the ability
to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));

This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(
    new FileStream(""fileName.dat"")));
aStream->putString( ""Hello world"" );
The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().

synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method

"
116,0,object_pool,"Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low.","
Object pools (otherwise known as resource pools) are used to manage the object caching. A client with access to a Object pool can avoid creating a new Objects by simply asking the pool for one that has already been instantiated instead. Generally the pool will be a growing pool, i.e. the pool itself will create new objects if the pool is empty, or we can have a pool, which restricts the number of objects created.It is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the Reusable Pool class is designed to be a singleton class.","The Object Pool lets others ""check out"" objects from its pool, when those objects are no longer needed by their processes, they are returned to the pool in order to be reused. However, we don't want a process to have to wait for a particular object to be released, so the Object Pool also instantiates new objects as they are required, but must also implement a facility to clean up unused objects periodically.","The general idea for the Connection Pool pattern is that if instances of a class can be reused, you avoid creating instances of the class by reusing them.


Reusable - 
 Instances of classes in this role collaborate with other objects for a limited amount of time, then they are no longer needed for that collaboration.
Client - 
 Instances of classes in this role use Reusable objects.
ReusablePool - 
 Instances of classes in this role manage Reusable objects for use by Client objects.
Usually, it is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the ReusablePool class is designed to be a singleton class. Its constructor(s) are private, which forces other classes to call its getInstance method to get the one instance of the ReusablePool class.A Client object calls a ReusablePool object's acquireReusable method when it needs a Reusable object. A ReusablePool object maintains a collection of Reusable objects. It uses the collection of Reusable objects to contain a pool of Reusable objects that are not currently in use.If there are any Reusable objects in the pool when the acquireReusable method is called, it removes a Reusable object from the pool and returns it. If the pool is empty, then the acquireReusable method creates a Reusable object if it can. If the acquireReusable method cannot create a new Reusable object, then it waits until a Reusable object is returned to the collection.Client objects pass a Reusable object to a ReusablePool object's releaseReusable method when they are finished with the object. The releaseReusable method returns a Reusable object to the pool of Reusable objects that are not in use.In many applications of the Object Pool pattern, there are reasons for limiting the total number of Reusable objects that may exist. In such cases, the ReusablePool object that creates Reusable objects is responsible for not creating more than a specified maximum number of Reusable objects. If ReusablePool objects are responsible for limiting the number of objects they will create, then the ReusablePool class will have a method for specifying the maximum number of objects to be created. That method is indicated in the above diagram as setMaxPoolSize."

Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.

delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,

efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with

","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."
124,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

125,0,iterator,"
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
The C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible
to decouple collection classes and algorithms.
Promote to ""full object status"" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
","Need to ""abstract"" the traversal of wildly different data structures
so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with
each transparently.","""An aggregate object such as a list should give you a way to access
its elements without exposing its internal structure.  Moreover, you
might want to traverse the list in different ways, depending on what
you need to accomplish.  But you probably don't want to bloat the List
interface with operations for different traversals, even if you
could anticipate the ones you'll require.  You might also need to have
more than one traversal pending on the same list."" And,
providing a uniform interface for traversing many types of aggregate
objects (i.e. polymorphic iteration) might be valuable.The Iterator pattern lets you do all this.  The key idea is to take the
responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object
and put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal
protocol.The Iterator abstraction is fundamental to an emerging technology
called ""generic programming"".  This strategy seeks to explicitly
separate the notion of ""algorithm"" from that of ""data structure"".  The
motivation is to: promote component-based development, boost
productivity, and reduce configuration management.As an example, if you wanted to support four data structures (array,
binary tree, linked list, and hash table) and three algorithms (sort,
find, and merge), a traditional approach would require four times three
permutations to develop and maintain.  Whereas, a generic programming
approach would only require four plus three configuration items.","The Client uses the Collection class' public interface directly.  But
access to the Collection's elements is encapsulated behind the
additional level of abstraction called Iterator.  Each Collection
derived class knows which Iterator derived class to create and return.
After that, the Client relies on the interface defined in the Iterator
base class.

"
126,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
127,0,strategy,"
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury
implementation details in derived classes.
","One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented
design is the ""open-closed principle"".Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved -
encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury
implementation details in derived classes.  Clients can
then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to
experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact
when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact
when the implementation of a derived class changes.

A generic value of the software community for years has been,
""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"".  The object-oriented
design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing
coupling.  Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction
(i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of
that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing
""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more
generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling""
principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection""
that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords.
The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"")
the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that
interface are effectively hidden.",,"The Interface entity could represent either an
abstract base class, or the method signature expectations by
the client.  In the former case, the inheritance hierarchy
represents dynamic polymorphism.  In the latter case, the Interface
entity represents template code in the client and the inheritance
hierarchy represents static polymorphism.

130,0,observer,"
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject
abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components
in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

Subject represents the core (or independent or common or engine)

131,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is
required.Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following
criteria are satisfied:
Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable
Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.The ""static member function accessor"" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer

133,0,builder,"
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
",An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.,"Separate the algorithm for interpreting (i.e. reading and parsing) a stored persistence mechanism (e.g. RTF files) from the algorithm for building and representing one of many target products (e.g. ASCII, TeX, text widget).  The focus/distinction is on creating complex aggregates.The ""director"" invokes ""builder"" services as it interprets the external format.  The ""builder"" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state.  When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the ""builder"".Affords finer control over the construction process.  Unlike creational patterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the control of the ""director"".","The Reader encapsulates the parsing of the common input.  The Builder hierarchy makes possible the polymorphic creation of many peculiar representations or targets.

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,

","Application ""hard wires"" the class of object to create in each
""new"" expression.","Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual ""clone""
method, and, maintains a dictionary of all ""cloneable"" concrete derived

derives itself from the abstract base class, registers its prototypical
instance, and implements the clone() operation.The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the ""new""
operator on a hard-wired class name, calls a ""clone"" operation on the
abstract base class, supplying a string or enumerated data type that
designates the particular concrete derived class desired.","The Factory knows how to find the correct Prototype, and each Product

"
135,0,adapter,"
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.
Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
","An ""off the shelf"" component offers compelling functionality that you
would like to reuse, but its ""view of the world"" is not compatible
with the philosophy and architecture of the system currently being
developed.","Reuse has always been painful and elusive.  One reason has been the
tribulation of designing something new, while reusing something old.
There is always something not quite right between the old and the new.
It may be physical dimensions or misalignment.  It may be timing or
synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method
expects to receive ""x, y, w, h"" parameters.  But the client wants
to pass ""upper left x and y"" and ""lower right x and y"".  This
incongruity can be reconciled by adding an additional level of
indirection – i.e. an Adapter object.

The Adapter could also be thought of as a ""wrapper"".

"
136,0,composite,"
Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.
Recursive composition
""Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory.""
1-to-many ""has a"" up the ""is a"" hierarchy
","Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of ""primitive""
and ""composite"" objects.  Processing of a primitive object is handled
one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently.
Having to query the ""type"" of each object before attempting to process
it is not desirable.","Define an abstract base class (Component) that specifies the behavior
that needs to be exercised uniformly across all primitive and composite
objects.  Subclass the Primitive and Composite classes off of the
Component class.  Each Composite object ""couples"" itself only to the
abstract type Component as it manages its ""children"".Use this pattern whenever you have ""composites that contain components,
each of which could be a composite"".Child management methods [e.g. addChild(), removeChild()] should
normally be defined in the Composite class.  Unfortunately, the desire
to treat Primitives and Composites uniformly requires that these
methods be moved to the abstract Component class.  See the ""Opinions""
section below for a discussion of ""safety"" versus ""transparency""
issues.","Composites that contain Components, each of which could be a
Composite.

137,0,factory_method,"
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate.  Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

"
138,0,decorator,"
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality.
Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively
wrapping it.
Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.
","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

But the Decorator pattern suggests giving the client the ability
to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));
aWidget->draw();
This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

Another example of cascading (or chaining) features together
to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(
    new FileStream(""fileName.dat"")));
aStream->putString( ""Hello world"" );
The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().
The client may, or may not, be interested in OptionalOne.doThis()
and OptionalTwo.doThis().  Each of these classes always
delegate to the Decorator base class, and that class always delegates
to the contained ""wrappee"" object.

140,0,bridge,"
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
can vary independently.
Publish interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury
implementation in its own inheritance hierarchy.
Beyond encapsulation, to insulation
","""Hardening of the software arteries"" has occurred by using subclassing
of an abstract base class to provide alternative implementations.  This
locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation.
The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or
composed.","Decompose the component's interface and implementation into orthogonal
class hierarchies.  The interface class contains a pointer to
the abstract implementation class.  This pointer is initialized with an
instance of a concrete implementation class, but all subsequent interaction
from the interface class to the implementation class is limited to the
abstraction maintained in the implementation base class.  The client
interacts with the interface class, and it in turn ""delegates"" all
requests to the implementation class.The interface object is the ""handle"" known and used by the client;
while the implementation object, or ""body"", is safely encapsulated to
ensure that it may continue to evolve, or be entirely replaced (or shared
at run-time.Use the Bridge pattern when:
you want run-time binding of the implementation,
you have a proliferation of classes resulting from a coupled
interface and numerous implementations,
you want to share an implementation among multiple objects,
you need to map orthogonal class hierarchies.
Consequences include:
decoupling the object's interface,
improved extensibility (you can extend (i.e. subclass) the
abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently),
hiding details from clients.
Bridge is a synonym for the ""handle/body"" idiom.  This is a design mechanism that
encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class.  The
former is the body, and the latter is the handle.  The handle is viewed
by the user as the actual class, but the work is done in the body.
""The handle/body class idiom may be used to decompose a complex
abstraction into smaller, more manageable classes.  The idiom may
reflect the sharing of a single resource by multiple classes that
control access to it (e.g. reference counting).""","The Client doesn't want to deal with platform-dependent details.

","A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the
overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",

"
142,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to

"
143,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.

144,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

"
145,0,abstract_factory,"
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible ""platforms"", and the construction of a suite of ""products"".
The new operator considered harmful.
","If an application is to be portable, it needs to
encapsulate platform dependencies.  These ""platforms""
might include: windowing system, operating system,
database, etc.  Too often, this encapsulation is not
engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements
with options for all currently supported platforms begin
to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.","Provide a level of indirection that abstracts the creation
of families of related or dependent objects without directly
specifying their concrete classes.  The ""factory"" object has
the responsibility for providing creation services for the
entire platform family.  Clients never create platform objects
directly, they ask the factory to do that for them.This mechanism makes exchanging product families easy because
the specific class of the factory object appears only once in
the application - where it is instantiated.  The application
can wholesale replace the entire family of products simply by
instantiating a different concrete instance of the abstract
factory.Because the service provided by the factory object is so
pervasive, it is routinely implemented as a Singleton.","The Abstract Factory defines a Factory Method per product.
Each Factory Method encapsulates the new operator
and the concrete, platform-specific, product classes.
Each ""platform"" is then modeled with a Factory derived class.

"
146,0,flyweight,"
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

"
147,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
148,0,command,"
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.
Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."
149,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

"
150,0,mediator,"
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction
independently.
Design an intermediary to decouple many peers.
Promote the many-to-many relationships between interacting peers
to ""full object status"".
","We want to design reusable components, but dependencies between the
potentially reusable pieces demonstrates the ""spaghetti code"" phenomenon
(trying to scoop a single serving results in an ""all or nothing clump"").","In Unix, permission to access system resources is managed at three levels
of granularity: world, group, and owner.  A group is a collection of users
intended to model some functional affiliation.  Each user on the system
can be a member of one or more groups, and each group can have zero or
more users assigned to it. Next figure shows three users that are
assigned to all three groups.

If we were to model this in software, we could decide to have User
objects coupled to Group objects, and Group objects coupled to User
objects.  Then when changes occur, both classes and all their
instances would be affected.An alternate approach would be to introduce ""an additional level of
indirection"" - take the mapping of users to groups and groups to
users, and make it an abstraction unto itself.  This
offers several advantages: Users and Groups are decoupled from one
another, many mappings can easily be maintained and manipulated
simultaneously, and the mapping abstraction can be extended in the
future by defining derived classes.

Partitioning a system into many objects generally enhances reusability,
but proliferating interconnections between those objects tend to reduce
it again.  The mediator object: encapsulates all interconnections, acts
as the hub of communication, is responsible for controlling and
coordinating the interactions of its clients, and promotes loose
coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.The Mediator pattern promotes a ""many-to-many relationship network"" to
""full object status"".  Modelling the inter-relationships with an object
enhances encapsulation, and allows the behavior of those
inter-relationships to be modified or extended through subclassing.An example where Mediator is useful is the design of a user and group
capability in an operating system.  A group can have zero or more
users, and, a  user can be a member of zero or more groups.  The
Mediator pattern provides a flexible and non-invasive way to associate
and manage users and groups.","

Colleagues (or peers) are not coupled to one another.  Each talks to
the Mediator, which in turn knows and conducts the orchestration of
the others.  The ""many to many"" mapping between colleagues that would
otherwise exist, has been ""promoted to full object status"".  This new
abstraction provides a locus of indirection where additional leverage
can be hosted.

"
151,0,null_object,"The intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design where ""nothing will come of nothing""Use the Null Object pattern when
an object requires a collaborator. The Null Object pattern does not introduce this collaboration--it makes use of a collaboration that already exists
some collaborator instances should do nothing
you want to abstract the handling of null away from the client
","Given that an object reference may be optionally null, and that the result of a null check is to do nothing or use some default value, how can the absence of an object — the presence of a null reference — be treated transparently?","Sometimes a class that requires a collaborator does not need the collaborator to do anything. However, the class wishes to treat a collaborator that does nothing the same way it treats one that actually provides behavior.Consider for example a simple screen saver which displays balls that move about the screen and have special color effects. This is easily achieved by creating a Ball class to represent the balls and using a Strategy pattern to control the ball's motion and another Strategy pattern to control the ball's color.It would then be trivial to write strategies for many different types of motion and color effects and create balls with any combination of those. However, to start with you want to create the simplest strategies possible to make sure everything is working. And these strategies could also be useful later since you want as strategies as possible strategies.

Now, the simplest strategy would be no strategy. That is do nothing, don't move and don't change color. However, the Strategy pattern requires the ball to have objects which implement the strategy interfaces. This is where the Null Object pattern becomes useful.Simply implement a NullMovementStrategy which doesn't move the ball and a NullColorStrategy which doesn't change the ball's color. Both of these can probably be implemented with essentially no code. All the methods in these classes do ""nothing"". They are perfect examples of the Null Object Pattern.The key to the Null Object pattern is an abstract class that defines the interface for all objects of this type. The Null Object is implemented as a subclass of this abstract class. Because it conforms to the abstract class' interface, it can be used any place this type of object is needed. As compared to using a special ""null"" value which doesn't actually implement the abstract interface and which must constantly be checked for with special code in any object which uses the abstract interface.It is sometimes thought that Null Objects are over simple and ""stupid"" but in truth a Null Object always knows exactly what needs to be done without interacting with any other objects. So in truth it is very ""smart.""","

in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller

155,0,strategy,"
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury
implementation details in derived classes.
","One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented
design is the ""open-closed principle"".Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved -
encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury
implementation details in derived classes.  Clients can
then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to
experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact
when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact
when the implementation of a derived class changes.

A generic value of the software community for years has been,
""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"".  The object-oriented
design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing
coupling.  Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction
(i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of
that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing
""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more
generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling""
principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection""
that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords.
The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"")
the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that
interface are effectively hidden.",,"The Interface entity could represent either an
abstract base class, or the method signature expectations by

"
156,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's

Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""

checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

158,0,visitor,"
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
structure.  Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing
the classes of the elements on which it operates.
The classic technique for recovering lost type information.
Do the right thing based on the type of two objects.
Double dispatch
","Many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on node
objects in a heterogeneous aggregate structure.  You want to avoid ""polluting""
the node classes with these operations.  And, you don't want to
have to query the type of each node and cast the pointer to the
correct type before performing the desired operation.","Visitor's primary purpose is to abstract functionality that can be
applied to an aggregate hierarchy of ""element"" objects.  The
approach encourages designing lightweight Element classes - because
processing functionality is removed from their list of
responsibilities.  New functionality can easily be added to the
original inheritance hierarchy by creating a new Visitor subclass.Visitor implements ""double dispatch"".  OO messages routinely manifest
""single dispatch"" - the operation that is executed depends on: the name
of the request, and the type of the receiver.  In ""double dispatch"",
the operation executed depends on:  the name of the request, and the
type of TWO receivers (the type of the Visitor and the type of the
element it visits).The implementation proceeds as follows.  Create a Visitor class
hierarchy that defines a pure virtual visit() method in the abstract
base class for each concrete derived class in the aggregate node
hierarchy.  Each visit() method accepts a single argument - a pointer
or reference to an original Element derived class.Each operation to be supported is modelled with a concrete derived
class of the Visitor hierarchy.  The visit() methods declared in the
Visitor base class are now defined in each derived subclass by
allocating the ""type query and cast"" code in the original
implementation to the appropriate overloaded visit() method.Add a single pure virtual accept() method to the base class of the
Element hierarchy.  accept() is defined to receive a single
argument - a pointer or reference to the abstract base class of the
Visitor hierarchy.Each concrete derived class of the Element hierarchy implements the
accept() method by simply calling the visit() method on the concrete
derived instance of the Visitor hierarchy that it was passed, passing
its ""this"" pointer as the sole argument.Everything for ""elements"" and ""visitors"" is now set-up.  When the client
needs an operation to be performed, (s)he creates an instance of the
Visitor object, calls the accept() method on each Element
object, and passes the Visitor object.The accept() method causes flow of control to find the correct Element
subclass.  Then when the visit() method is invoked, flow of control is
vectored to the correct Visitor subclass. accept() dispatch plus visit()
dispatch equals double dispatch.The Visitor pattern makes adding new operations (or utilities) easy -
simply add a new Visitor derived class.  But, if the subclasses in the
aggregate node hierarchy are not stable, keeping the Visitor subclasses
in sync requires a prohibitive amount of effort.An acknowledged objection to the Visitor pattern is that is represents
a regression to functional decomposition - separate the algorithms from
the data structures.  While this is a legitimate interpretation,
perhaps a better perspective/rationale is the goal of promoting
non-traditional behavior to full object status.","The Element hierarchy is instrumented with a ""universal method adapter"".
The implementation of accept() in each Element derived class
is always the same.  But – it cannot be moved to the Element base
class and inherited by all derived classes because a reference to
this in the Element class always maps to the base type
Element.

When the polymorphic firstDispatch() method is called
on an abstract First object, the concrete type of that
object is ""recovered"".  When the polymorphic secondDispatch()
method is called on an abstract Second object, its
concrete type is ""recovered"".  The application functionality
appropriate for this pair of types can now be exercised.

Object pools (otherwise known as resource pools) are used to manage the object caching. A client with access to a Object pool can avoid creating a new Objects by simply asking the pool for one that has already been instantiated instead. Generally the pool will be a growing pool, i.e. the pool itself will create new objects if the pool is empty, or we can have a pool, which restricts the number of objects created.It is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the Reusable Pool class is designed to be a singleton class.","The Object Pool lets others ""check out"" objects from its pool, when those objects are no longer needed by their processes, they are returned to the pool in order to be reused. However, we don't want a process to have to wait for a particular object to be released, so the Object Pool also instantiates new objects as they are required, but must also implement a facility to clean up unused objects periodically.","The general idea for the Connection Pool pattern is that if instances of a class can be reused, you avoid creating instances of the class by reusing them.

Usually, it is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the ReusablePool class is designed to be a singleton class. Its constructor(s) are private, which forces other classes to call its getInstance method to get the one instance of the ReusablePool class.A Client object calls a ReusablePool object's acquireReusable method when it needs a Reusable object. A ReusablePool object maintains a collection of Reusable objects. It uses the collection of Reusable objects to contain a pool of Reusable objects that are not currently in use.If there are any Reusable objects in the pool when the acquireReusable method is called, it removes a Reusable object from the pool and returns it. If the pool is empty, then the acquireReusable method creates a Reusable object if it can. If the acquireReusable method cannot create a new Reusable object, then it waits until a Reusable object is returned to the collection.Client objects pass a Reusable object to a ReusablePool object's releaseReusable method when they are finished with the object. The releaseReusable method returns a Reusable object to the pool of Reusable objects that are not in use.In many applications of the Object Pool pattern, there are reasons for limiting the total number of Reusable objects that may exist. In such cases, the ReusablePool object that creates Reusable objects is responsible for not creating more than a specified maximum number of Reusable objects. If ReusablePool objects are responsible for limiting the number of objects they will create, then the ReusablePool class will have a method for specifying the maximum number of objects to be created.

the specific class of the factory object appears only once in
the application - where it is instantiated.  The application
can wholesale replace the entire family of products simply by
instantiating a different concrete instance of the abstract
factory.Because the service provided by the factory object is so
pervasive, it is routinely implemented as a Singleton.","The Abstract Factory defines a Factory Method per product.

","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));

This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

Another example of cascading (or chaining) features together
to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(

The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().

criteria are satisfied:
Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable
Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.The ""static member function accessor"" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer
to the discussion in the book.Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem.

","""Hardening of the software arteries"" has occurred by using subclassing
of an abstract base class to provide alternative implementations.  This
locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation.
The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or
composed.","Decompose the component's interface and implementation into orthogonal
class hierarchies.  The interface class contains a pointer to
the abstract implementation class.  This pointer is initialized with an
instance of a concrete implementation class, but all subsequent interaction
from the interface class to the implementation class is limited to the
abstraction maintained in the implementation base class.  The client
interacts with the interface class, and it in turn ""delegates"" all
requests to the implementation class.The interface object is the ""handle"" known and used by the client;
while the implementation object, or ""body"", is safely encapsulated to
ensure that it may continue to evolve, or be entirely replaced (or shared

Consequences include:
decoupling the object's interface,
improved extensibility (you can extend (i.e. subclass) the
abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently),
hiding details from clients.
Bridge is a synonym for the ""handle/body"" idiom.  This is a design mechanism that
encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class.  The
former is the body, and the latter is the handle.  The handle is viewed
by the user as the actual class, but the work is done in the body.
""The handle/body class idiom may be used to decompose a complex
abstraction into smaller, more manageable classes.  The idiom may
reflect the sharing of a single resource by multiple classes that
control access to it (e.g. reference counting).""","The Client doesn't want to deal with platform-dependent details.

standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method

","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own

implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control

","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.


","By defining a Subject interface, the presence of the Proxy object
standing in place of the RealSubject is transparent to the client.

""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",
and interjects a wrapper that tames the amorphous and inscrutable
mass of software.

SubsystemOne and SubsystemThree do not
interact with the internal components of SubsystemTwo.
They use the SubsystemTwoWrapper ""facade"" (i.e. the
higher level abstraction).

179,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

"
180,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.


","By defining a Subject interface, the presence of the Proxy object
standing in place of the RealSubject is transparent to the client.

"
181,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
182,0,mediator,"
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction
independently.
Design an intermediary to decouple many peers.
Promote the many-to-many relationships between interacting peers
to ""full object status"".
","We want to design reusable components, but dependencies between the
potentially reusable pieces demonstrates the ""spaghetti code"" phenomenon
(trying to scoop a single serving results in an ""all or nothing clump"").","In Unix, permission to access system resources is managed at three levels
of granularity: world, group, and owner.  A group is a collection of users
intended to model some functional affiliation.  Each user on the system
can be a member of one or more groups, and each group can have zero or
more users assigned to it. Next figure shows three users that are
assigned to all three groups.

If we were to model this in software, we could decide to have User
objects coupled to Group objects, and Group objects coupled to User
objects.  Then when changes occur, both classes and all their
instances would be affected.An alternate approach would be to introduce ""an additional level of
indirection"" - take the mapping of users to groups and groups to
users, and make it an abstraction unto itself.  This
offers several advantages: Users and Groups are decoupled from one
another, many mappings can easily be maintained and manipulated
simultaneously, and the mapping abstraction can be extended in the
future by defining derived classes.

Partitioning a system into many objects generally enhances reusability,
but proliferating interconnections between those objects tend to reduce
it again.  The mediator object: encapsulates all interconnections, acts
as the hub of communication, is responsible for controlling and
coordinating the interactions of its clients, and promotes loose
coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.The Mediator pattern promotes a ""many-to-many relationship network"" to
""full object status"".  Modelling the inter-relationships with an object
enhances encapsulation, and allows the behavior of those
inter-relationships to be modified or extended through subclassing.An example where Mediator is useful is the design of a user and group
capability in an operating system.  A group can have zero or more
users, and, a  user can be a member of zero or more groups.  The
Mediator pattern provides a flexible and non-invasive way to associate
and manage users and groups.","

Colleagues (or peers) are not coupled to one another.  Each talks to
the Mediator, which in turn knows and conducts the orchestration of
the others.  The ""many to many"" mapping between colleagues that would
otherwise exist, has been ""promoted to full object status"".  This new
abstraction provides a locus of indirection where additional leverage
can be hosted.

"
183,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

"
184,0,null_object,"The intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design where ""nothing will come of nothing""Use the Null Object pattern when
an object requires a collaborator. The Null Object pattern does not introduce this collaboration--it makes use of a collaboration that already exists
some collaborator instances should do nothing
you want to abstract the handling of null away from the client
","Given that an object reference may be optionally null, and that the result of a null check is to do nothing or use some default value, how can the absence of an object — the presence of a null reference — be treated transparently?","Sometimes a class that requires a collaborator does not need the collaborator to do anything. However, the class wishes to treat a collaborator that does nothing the same way it treats one that actually provides behavior.Consider for example a simple screen saver which displays balls that move about the screen and have special color effects. This is easily achieved by creating a Ball class to represent the balls and using a Strategy pattern to control the ball's motion and another Strategy pattern to control the ball's color.It would then be trivial to write strategies for many different types of motion and color effects and create balls with any combination of those. However, to start with you want to create the simplest strategies possible to make sure everything is working. And these strategies could also be useful later since you want as strategies as possible strategies.

Now, the simplest strategy would be no strategy. That is do nothing, don't move and don't change color. However, the Strategy pattern requires the ball to have objects which implement the strategy interfaces. This is where the Null Object pattern becomes useful.Simply implement a NullMovementStrategy which doesn't move the ball and a NullColorStrategy which doesn't change the ball's color. Both of these can probably be implemented with essentially no code. All the methods in these classes do ""nothing"". They are perfect examples of the Null Object Pattern.The key to the Null Object pattern is an abstract class that defines the interface for all objects of this type. The Null Object is implemented as a subclass of this abstract class. Because it conforms to the abstract class' interface, it can be used any place this type of object is needed. As compared to using a special ""null"" value which doesn't actually implement the abstract interface and which must constantly be checked for with special code in any object which uses the abstract interface.It is sometimes thought that Null Objects are over simple and ""stupid"" but in truth a Null Object always knows exactly what needs to be done without interacting with any other objects. So in truth it is very ""smart.""","

","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

"
188,0,strategy,"
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury
implementation details in derived classes.
","One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented
design is the ""open-closed principle"".Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved -
encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury
implementation details in derived classes.  Clients can
then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to
experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact
when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact
when the implementation of a derived class changes.

A generic value of the software community for years has been,
""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"".  The object-oriented
design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing
coupling.  Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction
(i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of
that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing
""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more
generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling""
principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection""
that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords.
The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"")
the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that
interface are effectively hidden.",,"The Interface entity could represent either an
abstract base class, or the method signature expectations by
the client.  In the former case, the inheritance hierarchy
represents dynamic polymorphism.  In the latter case, the Interface
entity represents template code in the client and the inheritance
hierarchy represents static polymorphism.

"
189,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

"
190,0,visitor,"
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
structure.  Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing
the classes of the elements on which it operates.
The classic technique for recovering lost type information.
Do the right thing based on the type of two objects.
Double dispatch
","Many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on node
objects in a heterogeneous aggregate structure.  You want to avoid ""polluting""
the node classes with these operations.  And, you don't want to
have to query the type of each node and cast the pointer to the
correct type before performing the desired operation.","Visitor's primary purpose is to abstract functionality that can be
applied to an aggregate hierarchy of ""element"" objects.  The
approach encourages designing lightweight Element classes - because
processing functionality is removed from their list of
responsibilities.  New functionality can easily be added to the
original inheritance hierarchy by creating a new Visitor subclass.Visitor implements ""double dispatch"".  OO messages routinely manifest
""single dispatch"" - the operation that is executed depends on: the name
of the request, and the type of the receiver.  In ""double dispatch"",
the operation executed depends on:  the name of the request, and the
type of TWO receivers (the type of the Visitor and the type of the
element it visits).The implementation proceeds as follows.  Create a Visitor class
hierarchy that defines a pure virtual visit() method in the abstract
base class for each concrete derived class in the aggregate node
hierarchy.  Each visit() method accepts a single argument - a pointer
or reference to an original Element derived class.Each operation to be supported is modelled with a concrete derived
class of the Visitor hierarchy.  The visit() methods declared in the
Visitor base class are now defined in each derived subclass by
allocating the ""type query and cast"" code in the original
implementation to the appropriate overloaded visit() method.Add a single pure virtual accept() method to the base class of the
Element hierarchy.  accept() is defined to receive a single
argument - a pointer or reference to the abstract base class of the
Visitor hierarchy.Each concrete derived class of the Element hierarchy implements the
accept() method by simply calling the visit() method on the concrete
derived instance of the Visitor hierarchy that it was passed, passing
its ""this"" pointer as the sole argument.Everything for ""elements"" and ""visitors"" is now set-up.  When the client
needs an operation to be performed, (s)he creates an instance of the
Visitor object, calls the accept() method on each Element
object, and passes the Visitor object.The accept() method causes flow of control to find the correct Element
subclass.  Then when the visit() method is invoked, flow of control is
vectored to the correct Visitor subclass. accept() dispatch plus visit()
dispatch equals double dispatch.The Visitor pattern makes adding new operations (or utilities) easy -
simply add a new Visitor derived class.  But, if the subclasses in the
aggregate node hierarchy are not stable, keeping the Visitor subclasses
in sync requires a prohibitive amount of effort.An acknowledged objection to the Visitor pattern is that is represents
a regression to functional decomposition - separate the algorithms from
the data structures.  While this is a legitimate interpretation,
perhaps a better perspective/rationale is the goal of promoting
non-traditional behavior to full object status.","The Element hierarchy is instrumented with a ""universal method adapter"".
The implementation of accept() in each Element derived class
is always the same.  But – it cannot be moved to the Element base
class and inherited by all derived classes because a reference to
this in the Element class always maps to the base type
Element.

When the polymorphic firstDispatch() method is called
on an abstract First object, the concrete type of that
object is ""recovered"".  When the polymorphic secondDispatch()
method is called on an abstract Second object, its
concrete type is ""recovered"".  The application functionality
appropriate for this pair of types can now be exercised.

","If an application is to be portable, it needs to

the responsibility for providing creation services for the

the specific class of the factory object appears only once in
the application - where it is instantiated.  The application
can wholesale replace the entire family of products simply by
instantiating a different concrete instance of the abstract
factory.Because the service provided by the factory object is so
pervasive, it is routinely implemented as a Singleton.","The Abstract Factory defines a Factory Method per product.

of an abstract base class to provide alternative implementations.  This
locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation.
The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or
composed.","Decompose the component's interface and implementation into orthogonal
class hierarchies.  The interface class contains a pointer to
the abstract implementation class.  This pointer is initialized with an
instance of a concrete implementation class, but all subsequent interaction
from the interface class to the implementation class is limited to the
abstraction maintained in the implementation base class.  The client
interacts with the interface class, and it in turn ""delegates"" all
requests to the implementation class.The interface object is the ""handle"" known and used by the client;
while the implementation object, or ""body"", is safely encapsulated to
ensure that it may continue to evolve, or be entirely replaced (or shared

you want run-time binding of the implementation,

decoupling the object's interface,
improved extensibility (you can extend (i.e. subclass) the
abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently),
hiding details from clients.
Bridge is a synonym for the ""handle/body"" idiom.  This is a design mechanism that
encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class.  The
former is the body, and the latter is the handle.  The handle is viewed
by the user as the actual class, but the work is done in the body.
""The handle/body class idiom may be used to decompose a complex
abstraction into smaller, more manageable classes.  The idiom may
reflect the sharing of a single resource by multiple classes that
control access to it (e.g. reference counting).""","The Client doesn't want to deal with platform-dependent details.
The Bridge pattern encapsulates this complexity behind an abstraction

259,0,object_pool,"Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low.","
Object pools (otherwise known as resource pools) are used to manage the object caching. A client with access to a Object pool can avoid creating a new Objects by simply asking the pool for one that has already been instantiated instead. Generally the pool will be a growing pool, i.e. the pool itself will create new objects if the pool is empty, or we can have a pool, which restricts the number of objects created.It is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the Reusable Pool class is designed to be a singleton class.","The Object Pool lets others ""check out"" objects from its pool, when those objects are no longer needed by their processes, they are returned to the pool in order to be reused. However, we don't want a process to have to wait for a particular object to be released, so the Object Pool also instantiates new objects as they are required, but must also implement a facility to clean up unused objects periodically.","The general idea for the Connection Pool pattern is that if instances of a class can be reused, you avoid creating instances of the class by reusing them.


Reusable - 
 Instances of classes in this role collaborate with other objects for a limited amount of time, then they are no longer needed for that collaboration.
Client - 
 Instances of classes in this role use Reusable objects.
ReusablePool - 
 Instances of classes in this role manage Reusable objects for use by Client objects.
Usually, it is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy. To achieve this, the ReusablePool class is designed to be a singleton class. Its constructor(s) are private, which forces other classes to call its getInstance method to get the one instance of the ReusablePool class.A Client object calls a ReusablePool object's acquireReusable method when it needs a Reusable object. A ReusablePool object maintains a collection of Reusable objects. It uses the collection of Reusable objects to contain a pool of Reusable objects that are not currently in use.If there are any Reusable objects in the pool when the acquireReusable method is called, it removes a Reusable object from the pool and returns it. If the pool is empty, then the acquireReusable method creates a Reusable object if it can. If the acquireReusable method cannot create a new Reusable object, then it waits until a Reusable object is returned to the collection.Client objects pass a Reusable object to a ReusablePool object's releaseReusable method when they are finished with the object. The releaseReusable method returns a Reusable object to the pool of Reusable objects that are not in use.In many applications of the Object Pool pattern, there are reasons for limiting the total number of Reusable objects that may exist. In such cases, the ReusablePool object that creates Reusable objects is responsible for not creating more than a specified maximum number of Reusable objects. If ReusablePool objects are responsible for limiting the number of objects they will create, then the ReusablePool class will have a method for specifying the maximum number of objects to be created. That method is indicated in the above diagram as setMaxPoolSize."
260,0,decorator,"
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality.
Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively
wrapping it.
Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.
","You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time.
Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an
entire class.","Suppose you are working on a user interface toolkit and you wish to
support adding borders and scroll bars to windows.  You could define
an inheritance hierarchy like ...

But the Decorator pattern suggests giving the client the ability
to specify whatever combination of ""features"" is desired.
Widget* aWidget = new BorderDecorator(
  new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(
    new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(
      new Window( 80, 24 ))));
aWidget->draw();
This flexibility can be achieved with the following design

Another example of cascading (or chaining) features together
to produce a custom object might look like ...
Stream* aStream = new CompressingStream(
  new ASCII7Stream(
    new FileStream(""fileName.dat"")));
aStream->putString( ""Hello world"" );
The solution to this class of problems involves encapsulating the
original object inside an abstract  wrapper interface.  Both the decorator objects and
the core object inherit from this abstract interface.  The interface
uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited number of decorator
""layers"" to be added to each core object.Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an
object, not methods to an object's interface.  The interface presented
to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.Also note that the core object's identity has now been ""hidden"" inside
of a decorator object.  Trying to access the core object directly is
now a problem.","The client is always interested in CoreFunctionality.doThis().
The client may, or may not, be interested in OptionalOne.doThis()
and OptionalTwo.doThis().  Each of these classes always
delegate to the Decorator base class, and that class always delegates
to the contained ""wrappee"" object.

"
261,0,prototype,"
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future
instances.
The new operator considered harmful.
","Application ""hard wires"" the class of object to create in each
""new"" expression.","Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual ""clone""
method, and, maintains a dictionary of all ""cloneable"" concrete derived
classes.  Any class that needs a ""polymorphic constructor"" capability:
derives itself from the abstract base class, registers its prototypical
instance, and implements the clone() operation.The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the ""new""
operator on a hard-wired class name, calls a ""clone"" operation on the
abstract base class, supplying a string or enumerated data type that
designates the particular concrete derived class desired.","The Factory knows how to find the correct Prototype, and each Product
knows how to spawn new instances of itself.

"
262,0,singleton,"
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of
access to it.
Encapsulated ""just-in-time initialization"" or ""initialization on
first use"".
","Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object.  Additionally,
lazy initialization and global access are necessary.","Make the class of the single instance object responsible for creation,
initialization, access, and enforcement.  Declare the instance as a
private static data member.  Provide a public static member function
that encapsulates all initialization code, and provides access to the
instance.The client calls the accessor function (using the class name and scope
resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is
required.Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following
criteria are satisfied:
Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
Lazy initialization is desirable
Global access is not otherwise provided for
If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.The ""static member function accessor"" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer
to the discussion in the book.Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem.
  See ""To Kill A Singleton"" by John Vlissides for a discussion.","

Make the class of the single instance responsible for access and
""initialization on first use"".  The single instance is a private
static attribute. The accessor function is a public static method.

"
263,0,factory_method,"
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate.  Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a ""virtual"" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.
","A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of
applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own
domain objects and provide for their instantiation.","Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to
implementing an algorithm.  A superclass specifies all standard and
generic behavior (using pure virtual ""placeholders"" for creation
steps), and then delegates the creation details to subclasses that are
supplied by the client.Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more
complicated.  Other design patterns require new classes, whereas
Factory Method only requires a new operation.People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects;
but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes,
or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily
override (such as an initialization operation).Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis
on families.Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework,
and then implemented by the user of the framework.","The implementation of Factory Method discussed in the Gang of Four
(below) largely overlaps with that of Abstract Factory.  For that
reason, the presentation in this chapter focuses on the approach that has become popular since.

An increasingly popular definition of factory method is: a
static method of a class that returns an object
of that class' type. But unlike a constructor, the actual
object it returns might be an instance of a subclass.  Unlike
a constructor, an existing object might be reused, instead of
a new object created.  Unlike a constructor, factory methods
can have different and more descriptive names (e.g.
Color.make_RGB_color(float red, float green, float blue) and
Color.make_HSB_color(float hue, float saturation, float brightness)

The client is totally decoupled from the implementation details
of derived classes.  Polymorphic creation is now possible.

"
264,0,adapter,"
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.
Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
Impedance match an old component to a new system
","An ""off the shelf"" component offers compelling functionality that you
would like to reuse, but its ""view of the world"" is not compatible
with the philosophy and architecture of the system currently being
developed.","Reuse has always been painful and elusive.  One reason has been the
tribulation of designing something new, while reusing something old.
There is always something not quite right between the old and the new.
It may be physical dimensions or misalignment.  It may be timing or
synchronization.  It may be unfortunate assumptions or competing
standards.It is like the problem of inserting a new three-prong electrical plug
in an old two-prong wall outlet – some kind of adapter or
intermediary is necessary.

Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old
component to the new system.  Clients call methods on the Adapter
object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component.  This
strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with
aggregation.Adapter functions as a wrapper or modifier of an existing class.  It
provides a different or translated view of that class.","Below, a legacy Rectangle component's display() method
expects to receive ""x, y, w, h"" parameters.  But the client wants
to pass ""upper left x and y"" and ""lower right x and y"".  This
incongruity can be reconciled by adding an additional level of
indirection – i.e. an Adapter object.

The Adapter could also be thought of as a ""wrapper"".

"
265,0,builder,"
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
",An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.,"Separate the algorithm for interpreting (i.e. reading and parsing) a stored persistence mechanism (e.g. RTF files) from the algorithm for building and representing one of many target products (e.g. ASCII, TeX, text widget).  The focus/distinction is on creating complex aggregates.The ""director"" invokes ""builder"" services as it interprets the external format.  The ""builder"" creates part of the complex object each time it is called and maintains all intermediate state.  When the product is finished, the client retrieves the result from the ""builder"".Affords finer control over the construction process.  Unlike creational patterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the control of the ""director"".","The Reader encapsulates the parsing of the common input.  The Builder hierarchy makes possible the polymorphic creation of many peculiar representations or targets.

"
266,0,proxy,"
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed,
controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from
undue complexity.
","You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not
want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually
requested by the client.","Design a surrogate, or proxy, object that: instantiates the real object
the first time the client makes a request of the proxy, remembers the
identity of this real object, and forwards the instigating request to
this real object.  Then all subsequent requests are simply forwarded
directly to the encapsulated real object.There are four common situations in which the Proxy pattern is applicable.
A virtual proxy is a placeholder for ""expensive to create"" objects.
The real object is only created when a client first requests/accesses
the object.
A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object that
resides in a different address space.  This is what the ""stub"" code in
RPC and CORBA provides.
A protective proxy controls access to a sensitive master object.  The
""surrogate"" object checks that the caller has the access permissions
required prior to forwarding the request.
A smart proxy interposes additional actions when an object is
accessed.  Typical uses include:


Counting the number of references to the real object so that it
can be freed automatically when there are no more references (aka smart
pointer),
Loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced,
Checking that the real object is locked before it is accessed to
ensure that no other object can change it.


","By defining a Subject interface, the presence of the Proxy object

"
267,0,facade,"
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier
to use.
Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
","A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the
overall functionality of a complex subsystem.","Facade discusses encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single
interface object.  This reduces the learning curve necessary to
successfully leverage the subsystem.  It also promotes decoupling the
subsystem from its potentially many clients.  On the other hand, if the
Facade is the only access point for the subsystem, it will limit the
features and flexibility that ""power users"" may need.The Facade object should be a fairly simple advocate or facilitator.  It
should not become an all-knowing oracle or ""god"" object.","Facade takes a ""riddle wrapped in an enigma shrouded in mystery"",
and interjects a wrapper that tames the amorphous and inscrutable
mass of software.

SubsystemOne and SubsystemThree do not
interact with the internal components of SubsystemTwo.
They use the SubsystemTwoWrapper ""facade"" (i.e. the
higher level abstraction).

"
268,0,private_class_data,"
Control write access to class attributes
Separate data from methods that use it
Encapsulate class data initialization
Providing new type of final - final after constructor
","A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation.A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes.The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data).","The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility.It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.","The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class.

"
269,0,interpreter,"
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
the language.
Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar,
and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.
","A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and
well-understood domain.  If the domain were characterized with a
""language"", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation
""engine"".","The Interpreter pattern discusses: defining a domain language (i.e.
problem characterization) as a simple language grammar, representing
domain rules as language sentences, and interpreting these sentences to
solve the problem.  The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar
rule.  And since grammars are usually hierarchical in structure, an
inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.An abstract base class specifies the method interpret().  Each concrete
subclass implements interpret() by accepting (as an argument) the current
state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to the
problem solving process.","Interpreter suggests modeling the domain with a recursive grammar.
Each rule in the grammar is either a 'composite' (a rule that references
other rules) or a terminal (a leaf node in a tree structure). 
Interpreter relies on the recursive traversal of the Composite pattern
to interpret the 'sentences' it is asked to process.

"
271,0,iterator,"
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
The C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible
to decouple collection classes and algorithms.
Promote to ""full object status"" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
","Need to ""abstract"" the traversal of wildly different data structures
so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with
each transparently.","""An aggregate object such as a list should give you a way to access
its elements without exposing its internal structure.  Moreover, you
might want to traverse the list in different ways, depending on what
you need to accomplish.  But you probably don't want to bloat the List
interface with operations for different traversals, even if you
could anticipate the ones you'll require.  You might also need to have
more than one traversal pending on the same list."" And,
providing a uniform interface for traversing many types of aggregate
objects (i.e. polymorphic iteration) might be valuable.The Iterator pattern lets you do all this.  The key idea is to take the
responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object
and put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal
protocol.The Iterator abstraction is fundamental to an emerging technology
called ""generic programming"".  This strategy seeks to explicitly
separate the notion of ""algorithm"" from that of ""data structure"".  The
motivation is to: promote component-based development, boost
productivity, and reduce configuration management.As an example, if you wanted to support four data structures (array,
binary tree, linked list, and hash table) and three algorithms (sort,
find, and merge), a traditional approach would require four times three
permutations to develop and maintain.  Whereas, a generic programming
approach would only require four plus three configuration items.","The Client uses the Collection class' public interface directly.  But
access to the Collection's elements is encapsulated behind the
additional level of abstraction called Iterator.  Each Collection
derived class knows which Iterator derived class to create and return.
After that, the Client relies on the interface defined in the Iterator
base class.

"
272,0,command,"
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.
Promote ""invocation of a method on an object"" to full object status
An object-oriented callback
","Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the
operation being requested or the receiver of the request.","Command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one
that knows how to perform it.  To achieve this separation, the designer
creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an
action (a pointer to a member function).  The base class contains an
execute() method that simply calls the action on the receiver.All clients of Command objects treat each object as a ""black box"" by
simply invoking the object's virtual execute() method whenever the
client requires the object's ""service"".A Command class holds some subset of the following: an object, a
method to be applied to the object, and the arguments to be passed when
the method is applied.  The Command's ""execute"" method then causes
the pieces to come together.Sequences of Command objects can be assembled into composite (or macro)
commands.","The client that creates a command is not the same client that executes
it.  This separation provides flexibility in the timing and sequencing
of commands.  Materializing commands as objects means they can be
passed, staged, shared, loaded in a table, and otherwise instrumented
or manipulated like any other object.

Command objects can be thought of as ""tokens"" that are created by
one client that knows what need to be done, and passed to another
client that has the resources for doing it."
273,0,flyweight,"
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
The Motif GUI strategy of replacing heavy-weight widgets with
light-weight gadgets.
","Designing objects down to the lowest levels of system ""granularity""
provides optimal flexibility, but can be unacceptably expensive in
terms of performance and memory usage.","The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use
at fine granularity without prohibitive cost.  Each ""flyweight""
object is divided into two pieces:  the state-dependent (extrinsic)
part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part.  Intrinsic state is
stored (shared) in the Flyweight object.  Extrinsic state is stored or
computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its
operations are invoked.An illustration of this approach would be Motif widgets that have been
re-engineered as light-weight gadgets.  Whereas widgets are
""intelligent"" enough to stand on their own; gadgets exist in a
dependent relationship with their parent layout manager widget.  Each
layout manager provides context-dependent event handling, real estate
management, and resource services to its flyweight gadgets, and each
gadget is only responsible for context-independent state and behavior.","Flyweights are stored in a Factory's repository.  The client restrains
herself from creating Flyweights directly, and requests them from the
Factory.  Each Flyweight cannot stand on its own.  Any attributes that
would make sharing impossible must be supplied by the client whenever
a request is made of the Flyweight.  If the context lends itself to
""economy of scale"" (i.e. the client can easily compute or look-up the
necessary attributes), then the Flyweight pattern offers appropriate
leverage.

The Ant, Locust, and Cockroach
classes can be ""light-weight"" because their instance-specific state
has been de-encapsulated, or externalized, and must be supplied by
the client.

"
274,0,composite,"
Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.
Recursive composition
""Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory.""
1-to-many ""has a"" up the ""is a"" hierarchy
","Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of ""primitive""
and ""composite"" objects.  Processing of a primitive object is handled
one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently.
Having to query the ""type"" of each object before attempting to process
it is not desirable.","Define an abstract base class (Component) that specifies the behavior
that needs to be exercised uniformly across all primitive and composite
objects.  Subclass the Primitive and Composite classes off of the
Component class.  Each Composite object ""couples"" itself only to the
abstract type Component as it manages its ""children"".Use this pattern whenever you have ""composites that contain components,
each of which could be a composite"".Child management methods [e.g. addChild(), removeChild()] should
normally be defined in the Composite class.  Unfortunately, the desire
to treat Primitives and Composites uniformly requires that these
methods be moved to the abstract Component class.  See the ""Opinions""
section below for a discussion of ""safety"" versus ""transparency""
issues.","Composites that contain Components, each of which could be a
Composite.

275,0,chain_of_responsibility,"
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles
it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that
contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.
","There is a potentially variable number of ""handler"" or ""processing element""
or ""node"" objects, and a
stream of requests that must be handled.  Need to efficiently process
the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence,
or request-to-handler mappings.

","Encapsulate the processing elements inside a ""pipeline"" abstraction; and
have clients ""launch and leave"" their requests at the entrance to the
pipeline.

The pattern chains the receiving objects together, and then passes any
request messages from object to object until it reaches an object
capable of handling the message.  The number and type of handler
objects isn't known a priori, they can be configured dynamically.  The
chaining mechanism uses recursive composition to allow an unlimited
number of handlers to be linked.Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections.  Instead of
senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the
chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate
successor in the chain.Make sure there exists a ""safety net"" to ""catch"" any requests which
go unhandled.Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by
one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object
should handle the request.","The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.
If the ""current"" object is not available or sufficient, then it
delegates to the base class, which delegates to the ""next"" object,
and the circle of life continues.

Multiple handlers could contribute to the handling of each request.
The request can be passed down the entire length of the chain, with
the last link being careful not to delegate to a ""null next""."
276,0,mediator,"
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction
independently.
Design an intermediary to decouple many peers.
Promote the many-to-many relationships between interacting peers
to ""full object status"".
","We want to design reusable components, but dependencies between the
potentially reusable pieces demonstrates the ""spaghetti code"" phenomenon
(trying to scoop a single serving results in an ""all or nothing clump"").","In Unix, permission to access system resources is managed at three levels
of granularity: world, group, and owner.  A group is a collection of users
intended to model some functional affiliation.  Each user on the system
can be a member of one or more groups, and each group can have zero or
more users assigned to it. Next figure shows three users that are
assigned to all three groups.

If we were to model this in software, we could decide to have User
objects coupled to Group objects, and Group objects coupled to User
objects.  Then when changes occur, both classes and all their
instances would be affected.An alternate approach would be to introduce ""an additional level of
indirection"" - take the mapping of users to groups and groups to
users, and make it an abstraction unto itself.  This
offers several advantages: Users and Groups are decoupled from one
another, many mappings can easily be maintained and manipulated
simultaneously, and the mapping abstraction can be extended in the
future by defining derived classes.

Partitioning a system into many objects generally enhances reusability,
but proliferating interconnections between those objects tend to reduce
it again.  The mediator object: encapsulates all interconnections, acts
as the hub of communication, is responsible for controlling and
coordinating the interactions of its clients, and promotes loose
coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.The Mediator pattern promotes a ""many-to-many relationship network"" to
""full object status"".  Modelling the inter-relationships with an object
enhances encapsulation, and allows the behavior of those
inter-relationships to be modified or extended through subclassing.An example where Mediator is useful is the design of a user and group
capability in an operating system.  A group can have zero or more
users, and, a  user can be a member of zero or more groups.  The
Mediator pattern provides a flexible and non-invasive way to associate
and manage users and groups.","

Colleagues (or peers) are not coupled to one another.  Each talks to
the Mediator, which in turn knows and conducts the orchestration of
the others.  The ""many to many"" mapping between colleagues that would
otherwise exist, has been ""promoted to full object status"".  This new
abstraction provides a locus of indirection where additional leverage
can be hosted.

"
277,0,memento,"
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be returned to this state later.
A magic cookie that encapsulates a ""check point"" capability. 
Promote undo or rollback to full object status.
","Need to restore an object back to its previous state (e.g. ""undo""
or ""rollback"" operations).","The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to
checkpoint the source object's state.  The source object initializes
the Memento with a characterization of its state.  The client is the
""care-taker"" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and
retrieve information from the Memento (the Memento is ""opaque"" to the
client and all other objects).  If the client subsequently needs to
""rollback"" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the
source object for reinstatement.An unlimited ""undo"" and ""redo"" capability can be readily implemented
with a stack of Command objects and a stack of Memento objects.The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles: 
Originator - the object that knows how to save itself. 
Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself. 
Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

278,0,null_object,"The intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design where ""nothing will come of nothing""Use the Null Object pattern when
an object requires a collaborator. The Null Object pattern does not introduce this collaboration--it makes use of a collaboration that already exists
some collaborator instances should do nothing
you want to abstract the handling of null away from the client
","Given that an object reference may be optionally null, and that the result of a null check is to do nothing or use some default value, how can the absence of an object — the presence of a null reference — be treated transparently?","Sometimes a class that requires a collaborator does not need the collaborator to do anything. However, the class wishes to treat a collaborator that does nothing the same way it treats one that actually provides behavior.Consider for example a simple screen saver which displays balls that move about the screen and have special color effects. This is easily achieved by creating a Ball class to represent the balls and using a Strategy pattern to control the ball's motion and another Strategy pattern to control the ball's color.It would then be trivial to write strategies for many different types of motion and color effects and create balls with any combination of those. However, to start with you want to create the simplest strategies possible to make sure everything is working. And these strategies could also be useful later since you want as strategies as possible strategies.

Now, the simplest strategy would be no strategy. That is do nothing, don't move and don't change color. However, the Strategy pattern requires the ball to have objects which implement the strategy interfaces. This is where the Null Object pattern becomes useful.Simply implement a NullMovementStrategy which doesn't move the ball and a NullColorStrategy which doesn't change the ball's color. Both of these can probably be implemented with essentially no code. All the methods in these classes do ""nothing"". They are perfect examples of the Null Object Pattern.The key to the Null Object pattern is an abstract class that defines the interface for all objects of this type. The Null Object is implemented as a subclass of this abstract class. Because it conforms to the abstract class' interface, it can be used any place this type of object is needed. As compared to using a special ""null"" value which doesn't actually implement the abstract interface and which must constantly be checked for with special code in any object which uses the abstract interface.It is sometimes thought that Null Objects are over simple and ""stupid"" but in truth a Null Object always knows exactly what needs to be done without interacting with any other objects. So in truth it is very ""smart.""","


Client - requires a collaborator.

AbstractObject - declares the interface for Client's collaborator
implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes, as appropriate

RealObject - 
defines a concrete subclass of AbstractObject whose instances provide useful behavior that Client expects

NullObject - 
provides an interface identical to AbstractObject's so that a null object can be substituted for a real object
implements its interface to do nothing. What exactly it means to do nothing depends on what sort of behavior Client is expecting
when there is more than one way to do nothing, more than one NullObject class may be required


"
279,0,observer,"
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject
abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components
in an Observer hierarchy.
The ""View"" part of Model-View-Controller.
","A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or
monitoring requirements are levied.","Define an object that is the ""keeper"" of the data model and/or business
logic (the Subject).  Delegate all ""view"" functionality to decoupled and
distinct Observer objects.  Observers register themselves with the
Subject as they are created.  Whenever the Subject changes, it
broadcasts to all registered Observers that it has changed, and each
Observer queries the Subject for that subset of the Subject's state
that it is responsible for monitoring.This allows the number and ""type"" of ""view"" objects to be configured
dynamically, instead of being statically specified at compile-time.The protocol described above specifies a ""pull"" interaction model.  Instead
of the Subject ""pushing"" what has changed to all Observers, each Observer is
responsible for ""pulling"" its particular ""window of interest"" from the
Subject.  The ""push"" model compromises reuse, while the ""pull"" model is
less efficient.Issues that are discussed, but left to the discretion of the designer,
include:  implementing event compression (only sending a single change
broadcast after a series of consecutive changes has occurred), having a
single Observer monitoring multiple Subjects, and ensuring that a
Subject notify its Observers when it is about to go away.The Observer pattern captures the lion's share of the Model-View-Controller
architecture that has been a part of the Smalltalk community for years.","

Subject represents the core (or independent or common or engine)
abstraction.  Observer represents the variable (or dependent or
optional or user interface) abstraction.  The Subject prompts the
Observer objects to do their thing.  Each Observer can call back
to the Subject as needed."

"
281,0,strategy,"
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
vary independently from the clients that use it.
Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury
implementation details in derived classes.
","One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented
design is the ""open-closed principle"".Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved -
encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury
implementation details in derived classes.  Clients can
then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to
experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact
when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact
when the implementation of a derived class changes.

A generic value of the software community for years has been,
""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"".  The object-oriented
design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing
coupling.  Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction
(i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of
that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing
""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more
generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling""
principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection""
that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords.
The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"")
the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that
interface are effectively hidden.",,"The Interface entity could represent either an
abstract base class, or the method signature expectations by
the client.  In the former case, the inheritance hierarchy
represents dynamic polymorphism.  In the latter case, the Interface
entity represents template code in the client and the inheritance
hierarchy represents static polymorphism.

"
283,0,template_method,"
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to client subclasses.  Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
implement the placeholders.
","Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate
no reuse of common interface or implementation.  If a change common to
both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended.","The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are
invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable).  The
invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the
variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no
implementation at all.  The variant steps represent ""hooks"", or
""placeholders"", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's
client in a concrete derived class.The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and
the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend
or replace some number of these steps.Template Method is used prominently in frameworks.  Each framework
implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines
""placeholders"" for all necessary or interesting client customization
options.  In so doing, the framework becomes the ""center of the
universe"", and the client customizations are simply ""the third rock
from the sun"".  This inverted control structure has been affectionately
labelled ""the Hollywood principle"" - ""don't call us, we'll call you"".","

The implementation of template_method() is:
call step_one(), call step_two(),
and call step_three().  step_two()
is a ""hook"" method – a placeholder.  It is declared in
the base class, and then defined in derived classes.
Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template
Method a lot.  All reusable code is defined in the framework's
base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to
define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

"
284,0,visitor,"
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
structure.  Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing
the classes of the elements on which it operates.
The classic technique for recovering lost type information.
Do the right thing based on the type of two objects.
Double dispatch
","Many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on node
objects in a heterogeneous aggregate structure.  You want to avoid ""polluting""
the node classes with these operations.  And, you don't want to
have to query the type of each node and cast the pointer to the
correct type before performing the desired operation.","Visitor's primary purpose is to abstract functionality that can be
applied to an aggregate hierarchy of ""element"" objects.  The
approach encourages designing lightweight Element classes - because
processing functionality is removed from their list of
responsibilities.  New functionality can easily be added to the
original inheritance hierarchy by creating a new Visitor subclass.Visitor implements ""double dispatch"".  OO messages routinely manifest
""single dispatch"" - the operation that is executed depends on: the name
of the request, and the type of the receiver.  In ""double dispatch"",
the operation executed depends on:  the name of the request, and the
type of TWO receivers (the type of the Visitor and the type of the
element it visits).The implementation proceeds as follows.  Create a Visitor class
hierarchy that defines a pure virtual visit() method in the abstract
base class for each concrete derived class in the aggregate node
hierarchy.  Each visit() method accepts a single argument - a pointer
or reference to an original Element derived class.Each operation to be supported is modelled with a concrete derived
class of the Visitor hierarchy.  The visit() methods declared in the
Visitor base class are now defined in each derived subclass by
allocating the ""type query and cast"" code in the original
implementation to the appropriate overloaded visit() method.Add a single pure virtual accept() method to the base class of the
Element hierarchy.  accept() is defined to receive a single
argument - a pointer or reference to the abstract base class of the
Visitor hierarchy.Each concrete derived class of the Element hierarchy implements the
accept() method by simply calling the visit() method on the concrete
derived instance of the Visitor hierarchy that it was passed, passing
its ""this"" pointer as the sole argument.Everything for ""elements"" and ""visitors"" is now set-up.  When the client
needs an operation to be performed, (s)he creates an instance of the
Visitor object, calls the accept() method on each Element
object, and passes the Visitor object.The accept() method causes flow of control to find the correct Element
subclass.  Then when the visit() method is invoked, flow of control is
vectored to the correct Visitor subclass. accept() dispatch plus visit()
dispatch equals double dispatch.The Visitor pattern makes adding new operations (or utilities) easy -
simply add a new Visitor derived class.  But, if the subclasses in the
aggregate node hierarchy are not stable, keeping the Visitor subclasses
in sync requires a prohibitive amount of effort.An acknowledged objection to the Visitor pattern is that is represents
a regression to functional decomposition - separate the algorithms from
the data structures.  While this is a legitimate interpretation,
perhaps a better perspective/rationale is the goal of promoting
non-traditional behavior to full object status.","The Element hierarchy is instrumented with a ""universal method adapter"".
The implementation of accept() in each Element derived class
is always the same.  But – it cannot be moved to the Element base
class and inherited by all derived classes because a reference to
this in the Element class always maps to the base type
Element.

When the polymorphic firstDispatch() method is called
on an abstract First object, the concrete type of that
object is ""recovered"".  When the polymorphic secondDispatch()
method is called on an abstract Second object, its
concrete type is ""recovered"".  The application functionality
appropriate for this pair of types can now be exercised.
